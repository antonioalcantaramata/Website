# Profile Image Placeholder

Place your profile image here as `profile.jpg` or update the `src` attribute in `index.html` to point to your actual profile image.

The image should be:
- High quality (at least 400x400 pixels)
- Square format for best results with the circular crop
- Professional academic photo
- File formats: JPG, PNG, or WebP

You can also create subdirectories for different types of images:
- `cv/` - for CV/resume files
- `publications/` - for publication PDFs
- `research/` - for research-related images
- `teaching/` - for teaching materials

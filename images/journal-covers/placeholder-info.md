# Default Journal Cover

This directory needs a default journal cover image named `default-journal.png`.

You can create a simple placeholder image with the following specifications:
- Size: 200px width Ã— 250px height
- Background: Light gray (#f5f5f5)
- Text: "Journal" in center
- Format: PNG

Alternatively, you can use any generic academic/journal icon or create a simple branded placeholder.

## Quick CSS-based placeholder (temporary solution):

If you don't have images ready, the CSS includes a gray background fallback that will display until images are added.
